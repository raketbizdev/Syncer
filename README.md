# S3Syncer

## Overview

S3Syncer is a Python script that monitors a specified local directory for new or updated files and automatically uploads them to an Amazon S3 bucket. It uses the Watchdog library to detect file changes and the Boto3 library to interact with Amazon S3.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Watchdog
- Boto3

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:raketbizdev/Syncer.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory.

   ```
   cd Syncer
   ```

3. Install the required packages.

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. Open `aws_config.py` and fill in your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, and other configurations.

   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'
   AWS_REGION = 'YOUR_REGION'
   BUCKET_NAME = 'company-x'
   DIRECTORY_TO_WATCH = 'company-file'
   ```

2. Set up logging configurations in `logging_config.py` if needed. By default, logs are written to `s3syncer.log`.

## Usage

```
Run the script by executing:
```

This will start monitoring the directory specified in `aws_config.py`. Any new or updated files will automatically be uploaded to the configured S3 bucket.
